    <h2>Registry</h2>
      <p>Matt and Sarah have been living together for two years, and have acquired most essential household goods in that time, so they were somewhat reluctant to register for gifts&hellip; until they discovered <a href="https://www.zola.com">Zola registries</a>. The online registry is non-conventional: it includes options like contributing to a life fund, or gifting an experience. Check it out at <a href="https://www.zola.com/registry/matt-and-sarah">Zola</a></p>
      <p>For guests who prefer to give a material gift, there are some included on the registry website &mdash; but please know that any heirloom, hand-made, or otherwise unique gifts are absolutely appreciated!</p>
      <p>If you will be giving a registry item acquired through a different platform, you may <a href="mailto:maryclairechao@gmail.com">send an email to bridesmaid Mary Claire Chao</a> and request that a gift be marked as 'purchased' on Zola.</p>
